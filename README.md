# Data Science with Customer Data

This on-going project involves working with a dataset of bank customer satisfaction survey 
responses. The general objective here is to predict whether customers are satisfied 
with the bank based on their survey responses. 
(target is to create a web app and integrate a RAG model in the later stages)
